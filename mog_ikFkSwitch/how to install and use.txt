Universal IK FK Switch and Match Tool

DESCRIPTION:
This script lets you switch and match Poses between IK/FK controls in the animation scene.
Works for Riggs that don't have IK/FK match built in and requires only Standard FK controls and IK Pole Vector Setup.The Controls are defined once and can be stored in Node for easy re use throughout the animation.

INSTALL:

	a) Copy the file (mog_ikFkSwitch.py) to your Maya scripts directory. On Windows that is 	Documents/maya/20xx/scripts/

	b) Open Maya. In the Script Editor (Python), past the following code:

import pymel.core as pm
import mog_ikFkSwitch as mog_ikFkSwitch
reload(mog_ikFkSwitch)
mog_ikFkSwitch.FkIk_UI()


	c) Hit execute (or Ctrl Enter)

	The UI should open now.

USAGE:
	1. Define Limb to work on
	This always needs to be defined bofore loading/storing/switching
	Sides are treated seperately to not be restriced by naming convention

	2. Define Ctrls necessary by selecting them and hit the << button
	<< FK1: Upper arm
	<< FK2: Lower arm
	<< FK3: Hand
	<< IK Ctrl: IK Hand
	<< IK Pole:
	<< Switch Ctrl: The ctrl that is used to switch between ik and fk mode
	<< Switch Attr: The attribute that is dialed to switch.
					It can be highlighted in the channel box and hit <<

	Rotation Offset:
	Some Riggs have different orientations in their IK and FK ctrls and joints.
	This becomes obvious when running 'Match' and seeing a 90 degree offset in the wrist
	Set the offset and run 'Match' again to align them

	Switch IK/FK: Simple switches between the modes (does not do any matching)

	Select all IK or FK ctrls

	Key all IK/FK controsl on current frame

	Bake IK/FK: Bake the entire frame range to ik or fk. Leaves source keys clean



LIMITATIONS:
	- Pole Vector Control is required and will not run if controlled with attribute
	- Works only on Referenced Riggs


Future Improvements/Optimzations planned:
	 -   Make script work/not error if there is no polevector
	 -   create nodes in Rigg files and look for Referenced Nodes on Load
	 -   function on non-referenced riggs
