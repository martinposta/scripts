How to install LMspring:

First place the LMspring folder where you want it to be.
for example: "C:/Users/YOU/Documents/maya/scripts/LMspring".

Once you have the LMspring folder where you want it to be,
just drag`n`drop the "install.mel" file into Maya (drop in any viewport).

This will add the LMspring tool to the current shelf.

If you have a LMspring previous version installed, right click in the LMspring icons in the shelf and
delete them before you drag and drop the new "install.mel" file into the Maya viewport.
